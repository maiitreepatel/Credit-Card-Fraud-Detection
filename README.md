This GitHub repository hosts a Python project for credit card fraud detection using machine learning, implemented in Jupyter Notebook. It covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model development (using techniques like logistic regression, decision trees, etc.), model evaluation, and deployment/testing. The project aims to provide a practical guide for building fraud detection systems and encourages community contributions for enhancements and future improvements.
